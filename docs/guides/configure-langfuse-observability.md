# How to Configure Langfuse Observability for nanoinfra

nanoinfra can trace supported OpenAI-compatible provider calls through Langfuse's
OpenAI SDK wrapper.

## What you will build

- Langfuse installed in the same Python environment as nanoinfra
- Langfuse environment variables set before startup
- one traced nanoinfra model call

## When to use this

Use Langfuse when you need observability for model requests, latency, errors,
cost, or prompt behavior during development or production operation.

## Install

Install nanoinfra and prove the agent works:

```bash
python -m pip install nanoinfra
nanoinfra onboard --wizard
nanoinfra agent -m "Hello!"
```

Install Langfuse:

```bash
python -m pip install langfuse
```

## Minimal working example

Set credentials before starting nanoinfra:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="https://cloud.langfuse.com"
nanoinfra agent -m "Hello!"
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY = "sk-lf-..."
$env:LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY = "pk-lf-..."
$env:LANGFUSE_BASE_URL = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
nanoinfra agent -m "Hello!"
```

## Production notes

- Langfuse is configured with environment variables, not `config.json`.
- Start services from an environment that exports the same variables.
- Add tracing after the provider works; it should not be the first setup step.
- Native providers that do not use the OpenAI-compatible client path may not
  produce Langfuse OpenAI-wrapper traces.

## Security notes

- Treat Langfuse projects as observability stores for sensitive prompts and
  outputs.
- Use separate projects for personal, staging, and production traffic.
- Keep Langfuse keys out of committed service files.

## Troubleshooting

- If no traces appear, confirm the service process sees the environment
  variables.
- Confirm the provider path is OpenAI-compatible.
- Run one local `nanoinfra agent -m "Hello!"` call before debugging service logs.
