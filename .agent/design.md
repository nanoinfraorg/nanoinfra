# Design Constraints

These rules govern architectural decisions. When adding a feature or fixing a bug, prefer paths that respect these boundaries.

## Core stays small; extend at the edges

New capabilities should be added via `channels/`, `tools/`, skills, or MCP servers. The files `agent/loop.py` and `agent/runner.py` form the critical core path; changes there should be minimal and justified. If a feature can live in a channel adapter, a tool, or an external MCP server, it should not be inlined into the agent loop.

## Prefer duplication over premature abstraction

Channels and providers are allowed to repeat similar logic (send retries, media handling, message splitting). Do not introduce complex base classes or shared helpers just to eliminate duplication across channel files. Each channel file should remain self-contained and readable on its own. The same applies to provider implementations.

## Minimal change that solves the real problem

Fix bugs by changing only what is necessary. Do not bundle unrelated refactors or clean-ups into a feature or bugfix PR. If a refactor is genuinely required, it should be a separate PR targeting `nightly`.

## Explicit over magical

Configuration must be declared explicitly in `config/schema.py` Pydantic models. Error handling should raise clear exceptions rather than silently correcting bad input. Provider auto-detection exists, but every resolution path must be traceable from the factory to the concrete provider class.
